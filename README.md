HAND GESTURE RECOGNITION ROBOT

Gesture recognition is a topic in computer science and language technology with the goal of interpreting human gestures via mathematical algorithms. Gestures can originate from any bodily motion or state but commonly originate from the face or hand. Many approaches have been made using cameras and computer vision algorithms to interpret sign language. However, the identification and recognition of posture, gait, and human behaviors is also the subject of gesture recognition techniques. Gesture recognition can be seen as a way for computers to begin to understand human body language, thus building a richer bridge between machines and humans than primitive text user interfaces or even GUI.

		Gesture recognition enables humans to communicate with the machine and interact naturally without any mechanical devices. Using the concept of gesture recognition, it is possible to point a finger at the computer screen so that the cursor will move accordingly. This could potentially make conventional input devices such as mouse, keyboards and even touch screens redundant

		I propose a fast algorithm for automatically recognizing a limited set of gestures from hand for a robot control application. The mobile robot used by us is a FireBird V Atmega 2560 micro controlled robot designed by ERTS lab CSE IIT Bombay. Hand gesture recognition is a challenging problem in its general form. We consider a fixed set of manual commands and a reasonably structured environment, and develop a simple, yet effective, procedure for gesture recognition. Our approach contains steps for segmenting the hand region, locating the fingers, and finally classifying the gesture. The algorithm is invariant to translation, rotation, and scale of the hand. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique on real imagery.
